          <p>
            I've taken many classes for computer scinece in the last three years
            but the very first ones were taken at my origonal high school south
            lyon high. The first class I took was called visual basics one, it
            was a python class but I had no Idea what that was at the time.
            The class started off nothting like programming for the first three
            weeks we just solved puzzles and learned about charts and I didn't
            really see how it realated to programming but I always liked solving
            problems so I liked the class. After we started learning python not
            only did the puzzle solving and charts start to make sense but I also
            learned that computer programming was what I wanted to do for life.

          <p>
            After I realized what I wanted to do I started looking for more Classes
            I could take to further my knowlege of computer programming however
            there were no more classes for me to take at south lyon so I looked
            somewhere else. There was a program called oakland schools technical
            campus or OSTC. OSTC was basically a long elective where I could learn
            just computer programming for half of ever school day. My first language
            that I learned a lot about was java and I really liked it. I found OSTC
            to be a little to easy for so I looked for a more difficult program where
            I could take more computer programming classes and less normal Classes.
            Thats when I found the early college program where I didnt have to go
            to south lyon anymore and I could just go to OSTC and for the rest of
            my day I could enroll in Oakland Community College and that is what Im
            doing now.
